Description:
A Monte Carlo simulation is a type of computational algorithm that estimates the
    - probability of occurrence of an undeterminable event due to the involvement of random variables ***.
    - The algorithm relies on repeated random sampling in an attempt to determine the probability.
    - This means simulating an event with random inputs a large number of times to obtain your estimation.
    - You can determine other factors as well, and we will see that in the example.
